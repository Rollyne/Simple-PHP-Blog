# Simple-PHP-Blog
PHP blog for simple posts

Hello, in order to run the blog you will need a Apache server and MySQL database.
I used XAMPP. There are SQL codes in the 'db' folder you will need to run in order to create
a database called 'blog' and then fill it with sample users and posts.
When you have the server and database running you can use the blog.
